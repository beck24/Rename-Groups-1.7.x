Idea based on:
http://community.elgg.org/pg/plugins/project/385033/developer/c4lpt/rename-groups-as-communities
	
This plugin allows an admin to relabel the Elgg groups to
something more fitting for the site.
Many people have requested "Communities", "Societies" etc.

This plugin aims to provide a versatile way to name them
whatever you want.

Go to the plugin settings, enter in the singular version
and the plural version of what you want groups to be relabeled.

Supports the following plugins:

Blog
Bookmarks
Custom Index
Event Calendar
File
Group Contact List
Group Custom Layout
Groups
Notifications
Pages
Polls
Tidypics
Vazco Groupmailer
Vazco Mainpage

This plugin must be below all of these plugins to work properly.
This plugin will support multiple languages if someone wants to
provide translations of the language file.
